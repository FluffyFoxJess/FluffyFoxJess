Greetings and salutations. i would like to introduce myself to everyone 
I'm FluffyFoxJess,AKA Jess. this is just a little info on myself and on 
this website. First off ill explain my website, I would like to be able 
to say whatever I want no censorship alongside with anyone else wanting 
to have an uncensored voice. For far too long there have been only a 
certain groups that are allowed to say whatever they want without being 
censored and now I am turning the table on it to where anyone is able 
to say what they want, so let it flow everyone, lets debate or maybe
just vent about a certain issue that you are passionate about. Lets show 
certain people that we have a voice and it will be heard.
I'm also starting a website devoted to the study of the Bible if anyone is
interested. I'm very new to reading the Bible and I m trying to learn more 
about how to live the way God wants us to live and I welcome all advice or
help understanding some things about the Bible Thanks in advance and if 
anybody would like to have a Bible study with me I'll post the website once 
i completely have it set up for us I will pit the website in bold lettering 
so you don't miss it
